    "description": "Sunder Srivastava (Shahrukh Khan) is a young graduate whose main ambition in life is to fulfill his father's dream of starting a school on his half-acre property in his village, though he has no funds to execute his plans. Sunder's childhood friend Prem, a seasoned conman who operates in Bombay, convinces the gullible Sunder to mortgage his land to the village Zamindar (landlord) and fly to Dubai. Prem promises Sunder a handsomely paying teacher's job in Dubai that would give Sunder enough money to start his school within two years. Sunder does as told and arrives in Bombay to meet Prem; not only is there no sign of his friend at the station, but Sunder also gets unwittingly involved with a petty thief who robs him of all his luggage and money. To make matters worse, when Sunder reaches Prem's lodge, he finds an apologetic letter from Prem informing him that he has used his Rs.10,000 to get himself to Dubai instead and will one day repay him. Now at the end of his tether, Sunder wanders into an old Christian cemetery. Sitting on an old grave, Sunder gives vent to his frustrations and strikes the tombstone in helplessness, but immediately apologizes to the deceased. This amuses the ghost of Amar Kumar-- alias Marco (Naseeruddin Shah)-- who was killed and thrown into the grave 20 years before, only to rise at Sunder's apology. Marco explains to a frightened Sunder that he was a notorious Crime Don, who at the behest of his romantic partner Savitri (Malvika Tiwari), had resolved to give up crime, but was shot by his protÃ©gÃ© Kunta the day after the wedding. Marco seeks Sunder's help in getting even with his killers and promises Sunder a job and a place to stay in return. Marco manages to get Sunder a post in a school run by his father-in-law (Shammi Kapoor). Everyone grows fond of the new games teacher, including Marco's daughter (Urmila Matondkar). This last, a vivacious girl of an age with Sunder, courts the boy at least twice, accompanied by her largely invisible father. Kunta (Tinnu Anand) makes an attempt to capture the playing ground on the college campus. The college is starved of funds and proposes a cricket match to collect funds. Sunder and his team are helped by the invisible Marco, who cheats on their behalf and ensures victory. When Sunder tries to tell the others that he can see and talk to Marco, nobody believes him. In a final bid for victory, Kunta captures Sunder, Marco's daughter, and Marco's father-in-law, attempting to bury them alive. Marco rescues them and gives all the criminals led by Kunta a beating. He is about to kill Kunta when Sunder pleads with him not to do so. Marco forgives his enemy and lets him go. In time, Sunder marries Marco's daughter while Marco ascends to heaven. As he goes, Marco warns the children that although he came back to life for a second chance to do the right thing, they will not have the same chance; they therefore must make the best of what chances they have.",

    "description": "Bhagat was born in British India during the year 1908. As a child he witnessed numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by their British rulers, who came to trade under the guise of the East India Company, but ended up controlling most of the nation, and permitting tyrants such as General Dyer to massacre thousands of innocent men, women and children in Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi, especially his call to launch the non-cooperation movement, which led to thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up schools, & college studies, and government jobs - only to be let down by Gandhi himself when he called off the movement. Undaunted, Bhagat decided to be a revolutionary, starting with getting into petty fights, then as a grown-up joining the Hindustan Republic Association. When Lala Lajpat Rai was beaten to death by the police, Bhagat, along with Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and others daringly carried out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders, which eventually led to Bhagat's arrest, where he was lodged in a cell, tortured and beaten mercilessly. His father, Kishan, paid Rs.60,000/- and bailed him out, so that he could get him to run a diary-farm and get married to a girl from Manavali. But being a revolutionary was in Bhagat's blood, and when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, he would initiate the bombing in the Indian Parliament Building, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, be arrested, and tried in an open court. This is where Bhagat launched his much-publicized revolution, and became popular with the masses, especially the younger generation, laborers, and farmers, so much so that his popularity rivaled that of Gandhi himself. Even in prison, Bhagat made headline news when he and other prisoners undertook a 63 day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian freedom-fighter prisoners. Then the British re-opened the Saunders' murder case, which led to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Shivram, and Sukhdev. The entire nation rose up in protest, including the Congress party - with the ball being in Gandhi's court - for he was due to sign the Irwing Pact, and Indians hoped that he would use this as a bargaining chip to save the lives of the heroic trio. Will Gandhi rise up to the occasion and save the trio - so that they could pave the way for a modern and independent India, not just a country ruled by the British with a dominant status - an India free of communal hatred, injustice, corruption, and fundamentalism, or will Gandhi end up disappointing Bhagat all over again?",

She finds DJ, who graduated five years ago but still wants to be a part of the University because he doesn't think there's too much out there in the real world to look forward to. Karan, the son of Industrialist Rajnath Singhania, who shares an uncomfortable relationship with his father, but continues to live off him, albeit very grudgingly. Aslam, is a middle class Muslim boy, who lives in the by-lanes near Jama Masjid, poet, philosopher and guide to his friends. Sukhi, the group's baby, innocent, vulnerable and with a weakness for only one thing - girls. Laxman Pandey, the fundamentalist in the group, the only one who still believes that politics can make the world a better place and finally Sonia - the sole girl in the group, tomboy and vivacious spirit, engaged to Ajay - the dashing air pilot. Through her film, Sue wishes to showcase to the world the efforts of these young revolutionaries and the enormity of their contribution to the freedom movement in India. What unfolds is the inspiration behind Sue's passion for bringing their story to the world. The twist in the tale is of course the fact that more than just telling the world, Sue's film makes DJ and his friends stop and stare at themselves for being the actual descendants of these great men and never recognizing and celebrating their courage and spirit.",

When Kristal had difficulty booking country bands in his club on the Bowery he opened his doors to other kinds of rock music. Kristal had one demand of the acts he booked; they could only play original music. No top 40's, no covers. It was the credo he lived by, support the artist at whatever the cost. Hilly Kristal ironically became known as the godfather of punk giving a chance to such bands as Blondie, Television, Ramones, Talking Heads, Dead Boys and The Police.",

His confession and subsequent flashbacks showcases the apathy shown by authorities who refused to intervene during the destruction of the sacred Babri Masjid by Hindu Kar Sevaks, and the inability of the police to fulfill their mandate and protect the vulnerable, forcing many to flee to other locations. The subsequent aftermath that succeeded in irreversibly polarizing communities in Bombay; Pakistan's involvement in training and arms' supplies; the main alleged suspects, Dawood Ibrahim, and Mushtaq Memon, sought refuge in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, while Indian politicians made a cosmetic move to re-name Bombay; and of the little-known plot to assassinate right-winged politicians, Bal Thackeray and L.K.

Vijay manages to escape and is now on the lookout for the one last piece of evidence that can get him out of this mess. Helping him on the quest are two people. The first is a Roma, a young woman who was working in the gang, but only to avenge her brother's death. He had been mercilessly killed by Don when he had decided join the gang.

Shortly thereafter she gave birth to Jasmeet. Manmohan was always embarrassed of Bebo, as she was overly healthy and not quite sophisticated, as a result he always left her at home, while he socialized. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so got her admitted in an English Medium school, encouraged to mingle with Caucasian friends, and as a result Jasmeet was transformed in to Jazz - a stunningly beautiful young woman, British in looks, talk, habits, and heart. Manmohan's plans to get her married to an Indian boy are all in vain. His friend, Parvez Khan, is in a similar situation with his son, Imran, openly romancing a Caucasian blonde, Susan. Manmohan decides to take his family for a tour in India, and ends up getting her married to Arjun Singh. On their return to London, Jasmeet announces that she is getting married to Charles Brown, who is well connected, even with Prince Charles, and refuses to recognize her marriage with Arjun as there is no proof of this wedding. When Jasmeet is introduced to the friends of the Brown family, she is subjected to considerable racial profiling (snake charmers, Indian rope tricks, tandoori chicken) as well as a quote from Winston Churchil to wit: 'When we leave India, the country will be in the hands of goons'. while Imran is asked by Susan's parents to fore-go Islam, become a Christian, change his name to Emmanuel or Ian, as well as provide a written undertaking that his family is not associated with any terrorists. The questions that remain unanswered are: will love prevail ! Between Imran and Susan on one hand, and Jasmeet and Charles on the other? What is the impact of this marriage on Arjun, who now has been demoted from Husband to the Best Man?",

Whereas Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was about NRIs with Indian hearts, Pardes is about Westernized NRIs.) and hence the meaning of the title - \"foreign land\". Kishorilal is a successful businessman settled in America but still emotionally attached to his motherland - India. So the pardesi comes to India with his \"American\" son Rajiv to find a suitable '\"Indian\" girl for him. Kishorilal hopes his soon-to-be bahu will instill some Indian values in his extremely westernized beta. He finds his bahu in Kusum Ganga (a pet Subhash Ghai name just as Chandni was Yash Chopra's favorite for a long time) in the house of his childhood friend Suraj Dev. Mahima Chaudhary makes her debut as Ganga. To finalize the marriage he sends his son along with his foster son Arjun to India. Arjun plays Cupid and returns to America with Kusum and Rajiv. Arjun comes into the movie to get the American-boy to accept Indian values, and support the Indian-girl to accept American vices. The reverse does not fit into this movie. Arjun is portrayed as an Indian at heart and the hero of the film! All is hunky-dory till the true Bharatiya Nari finds out that her future husband is not a teetotaler. So, the heartbroken Kusum returns to India. Don't conclude that it is the end of the Bollywood fairy tale. It is just the beginning as Arjun falls in love with his would-have-been bhabi while playing Cupid and leads to a love triangle.",

Shalu is told the truth about her birth, given an ultimatum by Sarita to stop flirting with Dev, to which Shalu agrees. The question is will Dev also fall in line, or will he marry Nimmi, as Shalu's birth is questionable.",

The condition of the release includes Pat Jr.'s moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions, Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the \"silver linings\" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica, and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell, a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.",

The chatter of a quiet dinner party in posh Oxford Canyon is rudely interrupted as the real truths are set on the table. Fact and fiction intertwine as the couple's talk of ghosts and spirits from beyond which prompts them to take steps that will alter that night and their lives forever. Inspired by true events that shocked the world and to this day still frighten people everywhere, the film was shot on location on the infamous Cielo Drive a stones throw away from the site of the Manson/Tate murders. Supernatural forces from the past transport the dinner guests through time -- back to the night of the original killings. In a cruel twist of fate, they materialize as the soon-to-be victims of the massacre they had been discussing only minutes earlier. Is the knowledge of the future enough to shield them from the horrors of the \"helter-skelter\" mayhem from the past? Can careful plotting overpower the invasion by the most infamous family of mass murderers? Surely, yesterday is finally over. Only time will tell, as the visitors from the house at the end of the drive are swept into a hell storm of dark forces and fury almost beyond belief. Which is scarier the past or the present? Sometimes there is no difference!\"",

Politically, success knew no bounds for Emperor Akbar, After having secured the Hindu Kush, he furthered his realm by conquest until his empire extended from Afghanistan to the Bay of Bengal, and from the Himalayas to the Godhavari River. Through a shrewd blend of tolerance, generosity and force, Akbar won the allegiance of the Rajputs, the most belligerent Hindus. But little did Akbar know that when he married Jodhaa, a fiery Rajput princess, in order to further strengthen his relations with the Rajputs, he would in turn be embarking upon a new journey - the journey of true love. The daughter of King Bharmal of Amer, Jodhaa resented being reduced to a mere political pawn in this marriage of alliance, and Akbar's biggest challenge now did not merely lie in winning battles, but in winning the love of Jodhaa - a love hidden deep below resentment and extreme prejudice. Jodhaa Akbar is their untold love story.",

After the couple's passing, Uday takes over in his dad's footsteps, and takes it upon himself to try and get Sanjana married - in vain, as no one wants to be associated with a crime family. Then Uday's associate, Sagar Pandey, aspiring live-action painter, who had loved Iravati, got beat-up by her brothers, and was re-named Majnu, assists in finding a young man, Rajiv, who lives with his maternal uncle, Dr. Ghunghroo and aunt, and through extortion compels Ghunghroo to accept this alliance. But Ghunghroo, at the very first opportunity, gets Rajiv to fall in love with another young woman in Sun City, South Africa. When the time comes to get Rajiv formally engaged to this woman, he finds out that Sanjana and she are the very same woman. With no escape from this predicament, the wedding is planned, invitations are sent out, and even Ranvir Dhanraj alias RDX, an Italian-based criminal don, also makes an appearance. On the day of the engagement, a woman claiming to be Rajiv's child-hood betrothed shows up, makes a successful plea to Ranvir, and gets the engagement annulled. When Dr. Ghunghroo finds out that Rajiv and Sanjana have fallen in love with each other, he decides to accept Sanjana into the family on the condition that Uday gives up on crime. Rajiv and Sanjana attempt to get Uday to take up acting in a Bollywood movie - with considerable success - so much so that Uday has no time for crime.

Travers' Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.",

They found themselves stuck in an a poor lawless culture under extremely dangerous and life threatening conditions. To further complicate things, the trip was sponsored in part by a missions organization dead set on religious conversion of the Haitian people in the midst of the starvation, disease and mental illness. Much of images captured in this film were shot in places and of subject matter that even Haitian people never experience. Although the music is incredible and the scenery breathtaking, the omnipresent danger to the crew and horrific images of the people were enough to send any person over the edge. There will not be a film anything like this for a long time.....Guaranteed.",

    "description": "Calvin, an alcoholic wastrel, is forced to find a new job after he is fired from his grounds-keeping job at a golf course. After scaring away other potential applicants, he is hired to tend the grounds of a beautiful hillside mansion by Julie, the personal assistant to the owner of the home. Jack, heartbroken and suicidal, has refused to leave his property since his wife left him for a past love a year prior. On the night Jack decides to end it all, a drunken Calvin accidentally interrupts his boss' suicide attempt. Calvin convinces Jack that it's not worth it to kill himself when he has the means to continue living his reclusive lifestyle indefinitely. The two bond over their shared inclination to numb and preoccupy their minds rather than confront the pains of their past. When they can no longer run from their problems, their wills, and friendship, are truly tested.",

It's a grand carnival here that runs a vast spectrum, an interwoven tapestry of performing dancers, electric indie bands and stunning visual art. It's all been built on the fragile shoulders of Maddy Rose, the curator of the event. Through a near death experience at the tender age of eight, Maddy has received a both a curse and a mystical blessing. Her eyes snap with knowing apprehension at the struggling lives the patrons have brought with them this cold February night. Her friend Sol is here too, an amazing Momentum artist who must deal with an ex-girlfriend who has decided to attend with her new husband. Still trapped in the wounds of the past, he must climb the mountain of a first love lost, and find his true redemption. Sol's friend Pat is here as well. He's a poet waiting on uninterested friends tonight, and he feels alone and suicidal... but will surprises from his past save him in the end? And then we have tormented Rose. Adorned with a visually stunning corset created by local artist Nicole Moan, she must shatter the memories of her youth and in the end find acceptance and love. This film has a unique vision, a dramatic carousel of lives, both fictional and actual, taking place in a very real, non-fictional context.",

A conversation forms between captor and captive. The captor, Leonel Gomez, tries to understand killing and vengeance in a cosmological order while his captive, Rob Ager, is just trying to keep the conversation going as long as he can live. Sitting on a stretch of abandoned train tracks where the war began two years previous, Leo tries to keep some kind of grip on what's left of his humanity as he wields a knife in front of his last victim, Rob. Rob, handcuffed and sitting on the track as well, tries anything he can come up with to keep the conversation going and to appeal to his monstrous tormentor. To help Leo have a notion of grace and pity, Rob will do anything he can, even if that means bringing up his own innermost regrets. It is a story of moral and existential dilemma as a few young and tired crooks seek some kind of redemption in a world where nothing but bodies are left in their wake. You cannot bury the bad; It always comes back.",

His home is the winding path of the migrant: the back alley gravel, the crumbled pavement, and last - the river. Despite this perfect record, Miguel is no stranger to death. His nickname, \"El Maldito\" hints of what we will soon see for ourselves, for Miguel seems haunted by the dead and dying. He comes upon them on desert roads; he hears their confessions, and takes part in their dying wishes. Miguel's house, much like the man himself, stands alone; yellowed photographs breathe the sigh of a life given over to a singular purpose - crossing his people to a new life. There are signs that this quiet struggle is soon to break. When a terrible wreck draws Miguel to the roadside, the order of his life comes to ruin, for Elena, the wreck's lone survivor, recognizes Miguel.",

    "description": "As the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement rages, Robert and John, two New York investment bankers who are angered by the noise, smell and hassle of the protests venture into the park to let the \"One Percent\" be heard through their own counter movement, Occupy Occupy Wall Street. As they shout, picket and annoy their way to immediate press, their boss, Dustin, tries to shut them down due to the unwanted publicity their firm is receiving. Just as the curtain is about to fall on Robert and John's attention grabbing scheme (not to mention their own careers), the Board of the Bridgeport Youth Foundation, a potential client that they've been chasing for some time, comes to their salvation. Aside from their cause of helping underprivileged kids, the Bridgeport Youth Foundation's Board are Occupy-haters and applaud Robert and John's shenanigans. With their counter movement gaining momentum, Robert suddenly finds himself moved by the actual needs of the underprivileged kids associated with the Bridgeport Youth Foundation. Meanwhile, John is driven by his own desire to crawl out from under the influence of his powerful father -- a banker who sides with Mayor Bloomberg's political move to support the Occupy protestors. Despite the disapproval of their families, friends and co-workers and the growing physical threats from a mysterious tormentor, the bankers bumble their way into becoming the poster boys of the country's \"One Percent.\" When the Bridgeport Youth Foundation deal falls through, Robert and John learn that they're not the \"One Percent\" they've made themselves out to be. Poorer for their efforts, but with a new appreciation of their self-worth, they leave the park and their cause behind. However, when a last minute cash infusion from an unwelcome ally offers the deal new hope, Robert and John must decide between going against their own hard-won principles or taking the payout that's offered them and finally entering the shadowy, rarified ranks of the \"One Percent.\"",

Sam and Kate host a group of friends for dinner in hopes that sparks will fly between Kate's younger sister Cassie and their friend Ryan. Joining them at the table is Jon (Desmin Borges from FX's You're the Worst) and Dana, a couple with a seemingly perfect relationship. The first act of OPEN TABLES embraces a world where true love prevails and where even the most complicated of people can find their soul mate, even when - and sometimes because - their circumstances are unique. As the group dines, stories emerge. To impress Cassie, Ryan boasts about his sexual conquests; Jon and Dana tell the tale of betrayal that led to their connection, and Sam and Kate share the story of their friend Hannah, who falls in love with Dean (David Pasquesi from HBO's Veep) - a man who has no memory. The meal ends and the friends go their separate ways, introducing the second act of OPEN TABLES, where the heartbreaking side of love surfaces. Cassie, though disinterested in Ryan's bragging, agrees to join him for an usual first date; Jon and Dana deal with the realities of deception; and Hannah copes with the fallout after Dean regains his memory with no help from his doctor (Joel Murray). Told in flashbacks but always returning to the warm glow of the dinner table, OPEN TABLES stars talent from the Chicago theater and improv stages and was filmed on location in Chicago, IL and Paris, France.",

But much more than that it is an intensely dynamic study of the nature and perpetuation human conflict and how we manage to coexist, or perhaps simply survive, in the face of that. The story is powerfully illustrative of the fact that the struggle between hostility and compassion may well be the fiercest battle in which we, as a violent but nurturing species, are engaged. So, while 9/11 serves as centerpiece for the conflict and dialog within the piece, it is ultimately a frame of reference for this particular microcosm of human existence. Friendships are tested, tears are shed and laughter erupts all at unexpected moments as the seven men, most of them strangers, reveal their angers, regrets and, perhaps most deeply, their feelings of loneliness and despair following the loss of their friends and loved ones.",

    "description": "Summer 2012. A purported British intelligence operative alerts local newspaper journalist Megan Spring (Georgina Blackledge) to the precarious state of his failing operation and imminent exit from a life undercover. We quickly become immersed in the blurred world of alias 'Carl Hart' (Al Carretta). He sells passports, he keeps track of all clients involved and masterminds what remains of 'Operation Skyline' with the aid of Jimmy Knight (Redvers G Russell), an Interpol agent and the government acknowledged face on the file. Jimmy has bigger problems. His wife Tara (Emma Shearer-Hackett) has compromised him by tracking his 'other life' and making direct contact with the people who know nothing of his real career. Deadlines pass, Hart signals his operational absence to GCHQ in 2013 but Jimmy stays in the cold, happy to exist in the underworld. Cue 2014. With Jimmy Knight found dead and Hart not in operational contact, concerns rise and the attempt to identify the alias Carl Hart begins. Home Office investigator, Gemma Sinclair (Hannah Blaikie) takes the lead with Megan Spring's reporting. Unbeknown to Spring, she wasn't reporting at all. Used as a pawn by Hart, she simply asked known informants every trigger question that could flag abuse of investigatory powers. With the audience he is looking for, Interpol liaison Ellen Gates (Leah Cooper), the depth of 'Skyline' is explained as the jigsaw of government incompetence is revealed. Confessing his full identity, and citing years of available evidence, Hart's story checks out; even his wife, Lisa (Samantha Ervin), already in a witness protection scheme, is coming in to identify him. At a pass by location, Lisa fails to identify Carl and as the Police check him to be an unknown individual confirmation of his identity collapses. Gemma Sinclair reports back to her superiors and explains any criminal investigation into Skyline is impossible because of the confused line between operatives and informants and the condoned actions of all involved. As a dejected Sinclair arranges relocation for Jimmy's ex-girlfriend, Elisabeth Carter (Rebecca Bell) she comes face to face with the man no agency seems to know...",

The film begins as Victor arrives home in Toronto after traveling through Ethiopia, Jamaica and America, searching out his roots and the family he never knew and sharing his music with the people he meets. When he returns to Toronto, he finds that his love and compassion are desperately needed in his own circle of friends. The film tracks us throughout the summer of 2011 as his attempts to enrich the lives and relationships of young people struggling through bullying, racism, emotional, physical and sexual abuse. As he breaks down barriers of intolerance and bigotry, the people his actions affect find inspiration in him. Through his heartfelt, up-beat, catchy, and positive music, he is eventually able to bring both conflicted sides together. Victor's affirmations and encouragement shows young people that there is a way for them to fully believe in themselves and all of their potential. He wants them to find the gratitude in their lives, and to see all that they've overcome on their journey to find their freedom.",

To make ends meet she works as a caterer and, as the film opens, is left to tend to the post-funeral gathering for Hank Boyd, a quiet loner who stood accused of a horrific crime and took his own life before standing trial. Sarah knew Hank in high school and, while he was a strange kid, doesn't believe that he could do something so terrible. Her suspicions grow stronger after she meets Hank's brother David, a local cop with a checkered past, his dimwitted partner Ray who's charged with guarding the house, David's mother Beverly who's in the latter stages of dementia and Aubrey, his distant and obviously damaged younger sister. When Sarah overhears David and Ray talking her suspicions turn to alarm as it's implied they were somehow complicit in Hank's death and may have plans for her as well. Meanwhile Beverly has become convinced that Sarah is her long lost daughter while Aubrey pines for the affections of her big brother when she's not trying to ruin him. As the family is exposed and the bodies pile up, Sarah must give the performance of a lifetime if she hopes to survive, and all because... HANK BOYD IS DEAD it's a little funny.",

    "description": "The last time Helen entered The Cup Coffeehouse, she broke up with her bi-sexual boyfriend whose gay side was suddenly overshadowing his straight side as he flirted with Jamie, the flamboyant male waiter, right in front of her. She is now entering the Cup enticed by her own sexual curiosity. She has been dating Pike, the infamous dyky waitress, and has come to visit her at work. Jamie can't help but warn Pike to not get too whipped by the \"straight girl.\" The last time Gayle entered The Cup, she was informed that her daughter Stephanie was a lesbian. She was introduced to Stephanie's girlfriend Mary Ann and her unconventional reaction to all of this abrupt new information was astonishing. Gayle was not upset by her daughter's sexual orientation but rather very disappointed that Mary Ann was too boring and not nearly alternative enough to make her daughter's choice trendy. Gayle is now introducing the rainbow flag-flying coffee shop to Harold, a wealthy gay real estate broker. Jamie is instantly and surprisingly attracted to this older sugar daddy. Pike is freaked out when Mary Ann,with whom she has had a meaningless one night stand with, enters The Cup while Helen is there. Drama ensues as anger, jealousy, unexpected attraction and too much female as well as male estrogen explodes. What follows is a comedy of love-triangle errors made up of the most unusual combinations.",

She was launched in May 1908, and completed in July 1909. Emden was armed with ten 10.5 cm (4.1 in) guns and two torpedo tubes. Emden spent the majority of her career overseas in the German East Asia Squadron, based in Tsingtao, China. In 1913, she came under the command of Karl von Müller, who would captain the ship during her career in World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, Emden captured a Russian steamer and converted her into the commerce raider Cormoran. Emden rejoined the East Asia Squadron, after which she was detached for independent raiding in the Indian Ocean. The cruiser spent nearly two months operating in the region, and captured nearly two dozen ships. Müller took Emden to raid the Cocos Islands, where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. There, Emden was attacked by the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney. The more powerful Australian ship quickly inflicted serious damage and forced Müller to run his ship aground to prevent her from sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner, though the landing party, led by Hellmuth von Mücke commandeered an old schooner and eventually returned to Germany.",

Three survivors- Eli, Yaduik, and Zigney have managed to escape the madness of the concentration camp evacuations and death marches and remain hidden inside their barrack. Too terrified to go outside, the three of them wait for someone or something, to come. The Muselmann is a gritty Holocaust realism depicted through the narrow eyes of two survivors. At it's heart, the film is a horror-scape, a dialog of symbols, images, and emotions that underscore the Holocaust themes of dehumanization, isolation, brutality, and loss of faith. Embodying these qualities is Zigney, a frail remnant of a man, who haunts Eli and Yaduik, and reminds both of their fading humanity and impending fate.",

    "description": "'Who Are You (Glendale Edition)' is main compilation that sparks of the rest of the six movie compilations. All movies follow two story lines; to win your first love and the story of 'The Curse' of how Pasha saves the witch with the power of faith. The Glendale Edition reveals Pasha's obsession with Caucasian women being his first love.The message follows to go for your first love and \"don't go for the second best\" if you cannot avail it put it to the test. Pasha explains his first love is the \"Caucasian\" who the evil witch interferes with. The Madonna Message: Pasha derives his thematic message in his remixed music videos of 'The Curse' from Madonna's 'Express Yourself' music video. Pasha presents this message through french subtitles in his videos 'Don't go for second best'. 'Put your love to the test'. As well as the vocals are performed harshly, violently and dominantly to put the message through to win your first love rather than to go for the second, the second 'best' is never enough. In the remixed music video editions of \"Who Are You\" Pasha deliberately derives his thematic message from Madonna's 'Open Your Heart' music video. Pasha in his dance portrays himself someone wanting to love but is 'trapped' if released he 'can empower you with so much love.' 'the ability to love so greatly but trapped.' The french subtitles confirm this message. The main edit in black and white \"Who Are You (Blue Toys Club Mix) music video is a medley of 'The Curse' and 'Who Are You' remixes from which the film takes off. Omer Pasha stimulates energy through dance in Who Are You (Sacramento Edition), (San Diego Edition), (Santa Monica Edition) , (Hollywood City Edit), (Santa Clara Shoot) for his all white Caucasian women and men.'The Curse Creature' derives power from Christian and Jewish rituals. 'The Curse Creature is a horror looking creature that wears a black cloak. The Curse Creature loves and believes in Jesus Christ and vividly exposes himself in the Santa Barbara Edition on 'The Curse.",

Stylistically unique; the film is inspired by the true account of a young girl's survival in the Gas Chambers of Auschwitz Birkenau. The film uses ritual, mythology and fairy tale to present a dream-like journey through some of the darkest themes of human history. In a series of episodic stories, we are shown a picture of the Holocaust as a collective enterprise of persecution and extermination. The Girl Who Lived is a visceral, confronting, and emotive story, told with great beauty and dreamlike symbolism.",

To say that Herman (Aaron Beelner) is dissatisfied with would be an understatement of epic proportions. Unfulfilled working at his half brother's restaurant and unhappy with the typecast arc of his acting career, he is ready for something different. When Herman hears about an audition for the Mayor of Munchkinland in Martin Scorsese's big budget remake of The Wizard of Oz, his best friend (Kay Cannon, Writer of Pitch Perfect, 30 Rock) urges him to use the opportunity to transcend his inherent limitations and aim just a little bit higher. As life begins to imitate art, Herman and his crew of misfits find themselves on a humor-filled journey of self-discovery that delivers big laughs and even bigger insights into the lengths we'll go for the things that we love. Making his directorial debut, Matthew Perkins delivers a rare thing, indeed: a truly funny, often touching indie comedy.",

Meshing a journalist's perspective with a dramatic flair, Griffith has crafted a truly independent screenplay. The story unfolds in real time, and is told from Shoes' perspective. If there's a dollar to be made, he doesn't leave the bathroom. And if Shoes doesn't leave, neither does the viewer. Through years of meticulous journaling, Griffith secretly recorded hours of conversations with customers. The result is a fascinating exploration of the host/parasite relationships that are cultivated in this underbelly of Broadway. With disarming authenticity, Griffith uncovers glimpses of wisdom in the unlikeliest of characters. While the rest of the world tramples through the tourist traps above ground, take the journey down the long stairs, and step behind the curtain, to see how those on the fringe are living.",

He is paying two alimonies, his second ex-wife, Jill Davis, a lesbian, who is writing her own tell-all book of their acrimonious split. The one somewhat positive aspect of his life is that he is dating a young woman named Tracy, although she is only seventeen and still in high school. Largely because of their differences a big part of which is due to their ages, he does not see a long term future with her. His life has the potential to be even more tragicomical when he meets journalist Mary Wilkie, the mistress of his best friend, college professor Yale Pollack. Although Isaac's first impression of Mary is that she is a pretentious intellectual, he falls for her. They do become friends with the potential of becoming more than just friends as she knows that being the \"other woman\" in Yale's life is not a long term role that she wants. An Isaac/Mary coupling may complicate matters even more with Yale being mutually in their lives. Regardless, Isaac may be able to rationalize events after they happen, no matter what those events are.",

With wives and mothers long departed, Tobey Pritchard, his son Wayne, and his grandson, also Tobey, have lived alone for fifteen years. In recent years the catches have been slow, and disputes with Canadian fisherman have taken their toll on the family's livelihood. In the middle of the worst border dispute in years, a shy Canadian woman named Darcie moves into the house next door. As the three men vie for her attention, forgotten rivalries begin to resurface. Wayne has always resented his father for keeping him on the island and alienating his wife. Wayne's father and son see him as indecisive and weak. Old Tobey, while on the mainland getting groceries, is suddenly unable to recognize his car in the parking lot. When doctors determine that he's no longer competent to work on the lobster boat, Wayne and Young Tobey are left to provide for the family, now with the added expense of medical bills. As Old Tobey descends into dementia and forgetfulness, Darcie becomes his caretaker. Although initially friendly with Wayne, she now develops a close relationship with the older man. Wayne, again pushed aside by Tobey, must learn to forgive a father who is unable and unwilling to make amends.",

Local postman NED passes the hours inventing musical sub-genres. Resident cop TIPENE spends more time fishing than crime-fighting. The hardest decision for DAVE is whether to make pottery or go surfing while his ever-patient wife MAREEKA enjoys the serenity of their surrounds. But this idyllic life comes to an abrupt end when Ned delivers a fateful letter that could change their lives forever. It announces the arrival of multi-national mining corporation, Golia Minerals, who are questing for gold. The tightly-woven community is torn between those who welcome the promise of prosperity and those who oppose the mining of their sacred mountain. Whether through passive action or brazen defiance of the law, one thing's for sure - unless they can come together as a unified front, they'll loose what's most precious to them - their community and the land it dwells on. The Z-Nail Gang seamlessly weaves heart-warming characters into a community, environmental themes into a comedy, and erupts a dormant Maunga into the home of a real-life action adventure like no other. Some things really are worth more than gold.",

They play detectives tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearance of world-renown, reclusive author, Adrian Belmont, who vanished while researching Inuit mythological creatures called Qalupaliks. As the detectives are challenged with increasingly difficult puzzles within the game that take away their senses (vision, hearing, talking), they are forced to rely on one another, and find their real-world conflict coming out in the game's world.

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan's biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.",

Using Shakespeare's original language, the film follows free-spirited Rosalind and her cheeky cousin Celia as they throw off the shackles of childhood, disguise themselves as hipsters and run away to the city in order to experience life and love at its fullest. Along the way, they encounter a motley crew of San Francisco misfits including sensitive Silvius and his unrequited punk love Phebe, lugubrious stand-up comic Jacques and his blue-haired friend Audrey, and more. When the girls stumble on lovesick Orlando, who, blinded by love, is unable to see past Rosalind's masculine disguise, they decide to have a little fun. Rosalind, seizing the opportunity to test her love's love, offers to cure his sickness - all he has to do is call her Rosalind. After some hesitation, he agrees, and with that, she enacts every single womanly cliché she can think of in an attempt to make him hate her - something, she finally realizes, he is simply not capable of doing.",

Joe Casey has just died, and his family has gathered at the Casey house for the upcoming funeral. We first meet Joe's wife of forty years, Marilyn. The marriage between them was motivated by social expectation, not love. In keeping with the tradition in this type of marriage, Marilyn held the family together. Then there's Joe's youngest daughter, Barb. Barb has a slight physical handicap and at age 36 still lives at home. She has grown very dependent on Marilyn, out of habit not necessity. Next is Ellen, Joe's oldest daughter. Ellen left home when, at 18, she got pregnant and married. Since her divorce she has been independent, avoiding commitment and responsibility. Finally, there's Ellen's daughter Christy. Since her parents' divorce Christy has lived with her father, and for the last 10 years she has struggled to develop a relationship with Ellen, something Ellen has been avoiding. Christy's memories of the family are childhood memories of weekends at grandma's house, playing scrabble and drinking coke floats. Turns out, Joe's good reputation in the community never made it home, and the four women struggle to overcome Joe's previously unknown financial debts, as well as the damage he caused to each of them and their relationships with one another. Meanwhile, Ellen and Marilyn annoy Christy with their humorous approach to planning a funeral for the disdained deceased, and things get especially out of hand when the obtuse Barb implements her own funeral plans. Ultimately, the four of them are never more than one revelation away from digging their own graves, and the final revelation about Joe challenges their understanding of forgiveness and loyalty.",

Between ice cream, television and a severe case of writer's block, Sam mourns the loss of his youthful inspiration. After his stellar early success and the subsequent failure of his last project, Sam has become unable to move forward. Sherrie (Julie Mond), the provocative girl-next-door, offers him an easy and willing distraction. But it is Sam's budding friendship with another neighbor, Jeff (Blake Bashoff), which helps him begin to reconnect with his creative thread. After a ridiculous misunderstanding, the men start to spend time together. Their playful and unlikely camaraderie frees each of them from the weight of their pasts. But Sam reveals nothing of this to his wife Mary (Catherine Dent). And as he begins to change, she becomes increasingly suspicious about what is actually going on in the neighborhood. While searching for clues, Mary's anxieties take an abrupt new turn. Understandably hurt that Sam has become emotionally intimate with someone other than herself, she's doubly confused by the discovery that Sam's \"someone else\" is a man. As Sam begins to recapture his creative fire, he may be losing the one thing he has never doubted: his marriage.",

    "description": "The Unusual (Calling of) Charlie Christmas is the story of a socially awkward, thirty-two year old high school janitor who is inspired to become a costumed vigilante in his small Oklahoma town. Bullied and overlooked his entire life, Charlie receives his 'higher calling' even as his tender friendship with his neighbor, a meek and mysterious woman named Gracie, begins to develop into something more powerful. As Charlie begins to craft his crime fighting alter ego, the line between costumed hero and everyday reality begins to blur. He is guided by an apparition of Jesus as he begins to confront both the loss of his parents as a child and his fear of \"getting hit\" which stem from his own experience of being bullied. Flush with his new found conviction to rid the town of bullies he finds himself in a personal confrontation with Gracie's abusive boyfriend Brad. The conflict between Charlie and Brad serves as a parallel to Charlie's attempt to clean up the town's criminal element. While Charlie dispenses his own brand of \"masked\" justice to various street thugs and gangs he steps out from behind the mask to deal with Brad making this conflict more visceral. Charlie loves Gracie, if only at a distance, and Gracie sees Charlie as someone she may have loved if life had only taken a different path. Although their relationship seems hopeless and at times quietly desperate, it more than anything else is the catalyst for change in both of their lives.",

William Bradford Huie of Look magazine interviews the people of Money to get at the root of what happened. The two men acquitted for the boy's murder, Roy Bryant Jr. and J.W. Milam, agree to sit down to discuss the trial. Not a word had been uttered outside a courtroom by them or their kin, until now... * DAR HE: The Lynching of Emmett Till, is the TRUE STORY crafted from the public record: a transfixing, true-dramatization of the historic interviews and events surrounding the murder that became a lightning rod for moral outrage and pivotal in inspiring a whole generation of young people to commit to social change in the 1950s. 'His death was a spark that ignited the Civil Rights Movement in America,' Ed Bradley, Emmy Award-winning journalist. * The film was adapted from the acclaimed one-man play written and performed by Mike Wiley, similarly titled, Dar He: The Story of Emmett Till. * DAR HE is brought to you by the makers of two short films exploring the Emmett Till story: \"Empty Space\" (2009) and \"Wolf Call\" (2010), winners of 19 festival awards, 7 nominations, scores of official selections, special screenings, and other honors. \"Wolf Call\" was also nominated for a 2012 Black Reel Award for Outstanding Short Film. DAR HE is the pinnacle achievement of this work.",

    "description": "Grow Up, Tony Phillips may take place on Halloween, but it has nothing to do with horror movies and everything to do with that crystalline moment in time everyone has when they realize life marches forward and they're the youngest they'll ever be. It's a coming-of-age story, but this isn't an indie drama about a boy becoming a man. It's a comedy about Tony Phillips, a guy who doesn't think childhood passions should have an expiration date. This won't be teenage life as viewed from an adult's nostalgia-tinted rear view mirror. This is in every sense a teen's story told from the perspective of actual teenagers, both behind and in front of the camera. That means no hyper-meta dialogue, no larger-than-life scenarios, and no over-the-top style. This is all straight from Emily's heart.",

When a car crash on the way to a job interview lands her in the hospital, Blake offers to start the job in his sister's place, which turns out to be more complicated than expected: His ward is the homely and socially inept 20-year-old agoraphobic Giselle, who insists on a *female* assistant. However, the girl and her mother have never met Angela in person, and thus Blake is able to transform himself into a convincingly enough version of his sister. Realizing this gives him an opportunity to not only hide from the bookies but also from his visiting alcoholic mother, Blake moves gladly in with the disabled Giselle. At first reluctant, but consequently learning \"how to be a girl\" first in order to show Giselle how to be one, Blake unknowingly starts \"grooming\" Giselle into his dream girl.",

She is married to a man she does not love, stalked by an abusive ex boyfriend, and haunted by a dead girl who stares at her with a bloated bluish face and sad, questioning eyes. After a mishap, Sarah is instructed by her doctor to stay in bed. Begrudgingly she does. That is, until a strange older man moves in next door. A man with black teeth and an odd habit of sneaking into Sarah's yard to steal weeds. Emboldened by curiosity, Sarah sneaks into her neighbor's yard - only to be locked inside a greenhouse. After she breaks a glass pane to escape, she cuts herself and faints. Sarah wakes and learns the neighbor had treated her wound with a strange herbal ointment and brought her to the hospital. Eventually Sarah gets up the nerve to introduce herself to her next door neighbor. They form a fast friendship and, when Sarah sneaks a look into his picture scrapbook, she discovers an amazing secret. He's the same age in nearly every picture - pictures that span decades! Sarah discovers than her next door neighbor is over two thousand years old - a drifter with amazing stories and life experiences. But what is the secret behind his longevity and why did he enter her life when she is at her lowest point? When Sarah's husband goes away on an unexpected business trip, her ex boyfriend shows up at her door. Even though Sarah and her ex are now married to other people, in a moment of weakness they had a one-night stand several months ago. Doubting that Sarah would want to sleep with her loser husband, the ex suggests that he is the father of Sarah's baby. When Sarah coldly rejects him, her ex becomes enraged. Later that night, when Sarah's ex spies her sneaking over to her neighbor's house, his anger and jealously is uncontrollable. Events escalate to a violent confrontation that mortally injures Sarah's ancient next-door neighbor and puts Sarah and her unborn child in peril. Sarah Duncliffe - once a young woman who welcomed death - must now choose to fight to survive. BLESSID is a dark preternatural tale about two strangers who come together to find the beauty and purpose of life, and that forgiveness begins within oneself.",

Focusing around a football game where the different gangs play with and against each other, then at its grand finale, come together in a mass of union to defend their honour and their turf. Nostalgic stuff and above all a Rock n' Roll retrospective on a grand musical era. Timeless.",

They have few true friends as they believe all their contemporaries are intellectually inferior. Within their relationship, Artie is the dominant and Judd the submissive who says he will do whatever Artie tells him. Although Judd acts intellectually arrogant to others, he also shows signs of weakness and reticence most evident to Artie. Part of their goal in life is to experience how it feels to do everything. As such, they plot to commit what they consider the perfect crime - a kidnapping and murder - not only so that they can experience the sense of killing for killing's sake, but also taunt the law with the knowledge of it and their superiority after the fact. They believe their crime is above the law. Their murder of young Paulie Kessler is not so perfect, with evidence at the scene uncovered by one of their law school colleagues, Sid Brooks, who also works for the Globe newspaper. As Artie and Judd try to manipulate their way out of how the evidence may implicate them, their manipulation ultimately backfires and they are charged with the murder. The most famed trial lawyer in town, Jonathan Wilk, is hired to defend the pair despite his atheism being against the families' sensibilities. Jonathan, renowned for his ability to manipulate juries, has to decide how best to defend his clients in the overwhelming face of evidence against them. The testimony of Ruth Evans, Sid's girlfriend, may have some impact on the trial's outcome.",

    "description": "Set in 1920's New York City, this movie tells the story of idealistic young playwright David Shayne. Producer Julian Marx finally finds funding for the project from gangster Nick Valenti. The catch is that Nick's girl friend Olive Neal gets the part of a psychiatrist, and Olive is a bimbo who could never pass for a psychiatrist as well as being a dreadful actress. Agreeing to this first compromise is the first step to Broadway's complete seduction of David, who neglects longtime girl friend Ellen. Meanwhile David puts up with Warner Purcell, the leading man who is a compulsive eater, Helen Sinclair, the grand dame who wants her part jazzed up, and Cheech, Olive's interfering hitman / bodyguard. Eventually, the playwright must decide whether art or life is more important.",

    "description": "Our story follows four unlikely friends connected through social football when they fall victim to methamphetamine addiction. Thomas is a psychologist who has reached a crisis point in his life. Still single and borderline obsessive-compulsive, he needs help himself. Unable to cure a cheeky young drug addict, he starts wondering what else he can do besides quoting textbooks. Raj is usually just happy to follow his friends in their choice of adventures. He is an actor with a very slim credit list. There is a strong sense of \"now or never\" growing inside him. He is also aimlessly drifting in a dysfunctional relationship with his overly controlling girlfriend. Nick is a seriously conflicted, angry, and slightly racist Catholic priest with a hidden past. He is clinging desperately to the ideal of being a priest because this is the only direction he has in life. But something deep down inside him knows that he is living a lie. Jimmy is a sex-obsessed unscrupulous used car salesman, an ex-criminal struggling to go straight. He strains to project the image of a suave entrepreneur, but in reality his business is falling apart. No stranger to illicit substances, Jimmy becomes a devil's advocate when Nick is presented with a bag of meth by a worried parishioner. Acting as the catalyst, the drug sends our four friends on a disastrous yet hilarious roller-coaster ride that will change their lives forever.",
