Sunder's childhood friend Prem, a seasoned conman who operates in Bombay, convinces the gullible Sunder to mortgage his land to the village Zamindar (landlord) and fly to Dubai. Prem promises Sunder a handsomely paying teacher's job in Dubai that would give Sunder enough money to start his school within two years. Sunder does as told and arrives in Bombay to meet Prem; not only is there no sign of his friend at the station, but Sunder also gets unwittingly involved with a petty thief who robs him of all his luggage and money. To make matters worse, when Sunder reaches Prem's lodge, he finds an apologetic letter from Prem informing him that he has used his Rs.10,000 to get himself to Dubai instead and will one day repay him. Now at the end of his tether, Sunder wanders into an old Christian cemetery. Sitting on an old grave, Sunder gives vent to his frustrations and strikes the tombstone in helplessness, but immediately apologizes to the deceased. This amuses the ghost of Amar Kumar-- alias Marco (Naseeruddin Shah)-- who was killed and thrown into the grave 20 years before, only to rise at Sunder's apology. Marco explains to a frightened Sunder that he was a notorious Crime Don, who at the behest of his romantic partner Savitri (Malvika Tiwari), had resolved to give up crime, but was shot by his protÃ©gÃ© Kunta the day after the wedding. Marco seeks Sunder's help in getting even with his killers and promises Sunder a job and a place to stay in return. Marco manages to get Sunder a post in a school run by his father-in-law (Shammi Kapoor). Everyone grows fond of the new games teacher, including Marco's daughter (Urmila Matondkar). This last, a vivacious girl of an age with Sunder, courts the boy at least twice, accompanied by her largely invisible father. Kunta (Tinnu Anand) makes an attempt to capture the playing ground on the college campus. The college is starved of funds and proposes a cricket match to collect funds. Sunder and his team are helped by the invisible Marco, who cheats on their behalf and ensures victory. When Sunder tries to tell the others that he can see and talk to Marco, nobody believes him. In a final bid for victory, Kunta captures Sunder, Marco's daughter, and Marco's father-in-law, attempting to bury them alive. Marco rescues them and gives all the criminals led by Kunta a beating. He is about to kill Kunta when Sunder pleads with him not to do so. Marco forgives his enemy and lets him go. In time, Sunder marries Marco's daughter while Marco ascends to heaven. As he goes, Marco warns the children that although he came back to life for a second chance to do the right thing, they will not have the same chance; they therefore must make the best of what chances they have.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODkwNTM0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA3MzYzMQ@@._V1._SX54_CR005474_.jpg,Hindi                    ,tt0126234

As a child he witnessed numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by their British rulers, who came to trade under the guise of the East India Company, but ended up controlling most of the nation, and permitting tyrants such as General Dyer to massacre thousands of innocent men, women and children in Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi, especially his call to launch the non-cooperation movement, which led to thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up schools, & college studies, and government jobs - only to be let down by Gandhi himself when he called off the movement. Undaunted, Bhagat decided to be a revolutionary, starting with getting into petty fights, then as a grown-up joining the Hindustan Republic Association. When Lala Lajpat Rai was beaten to death by the police, Bhagat, along with Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and others daringly carried out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders, which eventually led to Bhagat's arrest, where he was lodged in a cell, tortured and beaten mercilessly. His father, Kishan, paid Rs.60,000/- and bailed him out, so that he could get him to run a diary-farm and get married to a girl from Manavali. But being a revolutionary was in Bhagat's blood, and when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, he would initiate the bombing in the Indian Parliament Building, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, be arrested, and tried in an open court. This is where Bhagat launched his much-publicized revolution, and became popular with the masses, especially the younger generation, laborers, and farmers, so much so that his popularity rivaled that of Gandhi himself. Even in prison, Bhagat made headline news when he and other prisoners undertook a 63 day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian freedom-fighter prisoners. Then the British re-opened the Saunders' murder case, which led to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Shivram, and Sukhdev. The entire nation rose up in protest, including the Congress party - with the ball being in Gandhi's court - for he was due to sign the Irwing Pact, and Indians hoped that he would use this as a bargaining chip to save the lives of the heroic trio. Will Gandhi rise up to the occasion and save the trio - so that they could pave the way for a modern and independent India, not just a country ruled by the British with a dominant status - an India free of communal hatred, injustice, corruption, and fundamentalism, or will Gandhi end up disappointing Bhagat all over again?",http://i.media-imdb.com/images/SF1f0a42ee1aa08d477a576fbbf7562eed/realm/feature.gif,Hindi                    ,tt0319736

The group gets a contract to stage 30 plays in Britain, however, on the day of the departure, Anjali opts out, leaving Champak no alternative but to travel without a heroine, but hoping to recruit one while in Britain. Upon arrival, Babla sets about to find a suitable heroine from the Indian population, but Bunty beats him to it and recruits a woman named Munni. Babla has his suitcase switched by another containing heroin, and as a result both men end being suspects by the local Police, whose Commissioner is an Indian, J.D. Mehra. Then both Munni and Bunty fall in love with each other. Then Munni has an accident with a vehicle and ends up in a hospital. When she regains her senses, she tells everyone that she is Nisha Chauhan, and is married to Vikram, who lives in Liverpool. Vikram arrives, thanks everyone, and takes his wife, who has suicidal tendencies, home. A few days later, Bunty receives a phone call from a frantic Nisha, who tells him to come over immediately. He, along with Champak and Babla, arrive there to find her body in flames. She is declared dead in hospital. Now the troupe is on the hunt for another heroine for their play - when the unexplainable happens - as Bunty claims that he saw Nisha. No one believes him, but then subsequently a terrified Champak and then a bewildered Babla both claim to have seen her. These sighting hurl the trio in a non-stop chaotic situation involving drug dealers, goons who want revenge, as well as the Police Commissioner himself, who also has a role to play in this comedy of errors and terrors.",http://i.media-imdb.com/images/SF1f0a42ee1aa08d477a576fbbf7562eed/realm/feature.gif,Hindi                    ,tt0805184

So, while 9/11 serves as centerpiece for the conflict and dialog within the piece, it is ultimately a frame of reference for this particular microcosm of human existence.

He sells passports, he keeps track of all clients involved and masterminds what remains of 'Operation Skyline' with the aid of Jimmy Knight (Redvers G Russell), an Interpol agent and the government acknowledged face on the file. Jimmy has bigger problems. His wife Tara (Emma Shearer-Hackett) has compromised him by tracking his 'other life' and making direct contact with the people who know nothing of his real career.

With Jimmy Knight found dead and Hart not in operational contact, concerns rise and the attempt to identify the alias Carl Hart begins. Home Office investigator, Gemma Sinclair (Hannah Blaikie) takes the lead with Megan Spring's reporting. Unbeknown to Spring, she wasn't reporting at all. Used as a pawn by Hart, she simply asked known informants every trigger question that could flag abuse of investigatory powers. With the audience he is looking for, Interpol liaison Ellen Gates (Leah Cooper), the depth of 'Skyline' is explained as the jigsaw of government incompetence is revealed. Confessing his full identity, and citing years of available evidence, Hart's story checks out; even his wife, Lisa (Samantha Ervin), already in a witness protection scheme, is coming in to identify him. At a pass by location, Lisa fails to identify Carl and as the Police check him to be an unknown individual confirmation of his identity collapses.

She was launched in May 1908, and completed in July 1909. Emden was armed with ten 10.5 cm (4.1 in) guns and two torpedo tubes. Emden spent the majority of her career overseas in the German East Asia Squadron, based in Tsingtao, China. In 1913, she came under the command of Karl von Müller, who would captain the ship during her career in World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, Emden captured a Russian steamer and converted her into the commerce raider Cormoran. Emden rejoined the East Asia Squadron, after which she was detached for independent raiding in the Indian Ocean. The cruiser spent nearly two months operating in the region, and captured nearly two dozen ships. Müller took Emden to raid the Cocos Islands, where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. There, Emden was attacked by the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney. The more powerful Australian ship quickly inflicted serious damage and forced Müller to run his ship aground to prevent her from sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner, though the landing party, led by Hellmuth von Mücke commandeered an old schooner and eventually returned to Germany.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMDgyODMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxMjU5MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg,English                  ,tt3391228

Joe Casey has just died, and his family has gathered at the Casey house for the upcoming funeral. We first meet Joe's wife of forty years, Marilyn. The marriage between them was motivated by social expectation, not love. In keeping with the tradition in this type of marriage, Marilyn held the family together. Then there's Joe's youngest daughter, Barb. Barb has a slight physical handicap and at age 36 still lives at home. She has grown very dependent on Marilyn, out of habit not necessity. Next is Ellen, Joe's oldest daughter. Ellen left home when, at 18, she got pregnant and married. Since her divorce she has been independent, avoiding commitment and responsibility. Finally, there's Ellen's daughter Christy. Since her parents' divorce Christy has lived with her father, and for the last 10 years she has struggled to develop a relationship with Ellen, something Ellen has been avoiding. Christy's memories of the family are childhood memories of weekends at grandma's house, playing scrabble and drinking coke floats. Turns out, Joe's good reputation in the community never made it home, and the four women struggle to overcome Joe's previously unknown financial debts, as well as the damage he caused to each of them and their relationships with one another. Meanwhile, Ellen and Marilyn annoy Christy with their humorous approach to planning a funeral for the disdained deceased, and things get especially out of hand when the obtuse Barb implements her own funeral plans. Ultimately, the four of them are never more than one revelation away from digging their own graves, and the final revelation about Joe challenges their understanding of forgiveness and loyalty.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzQyMDMzNzIzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQyMDMwMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,English                  ,tt2768052
